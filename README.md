# Welcome to the First Zappi Elixir Workshop!

Hey there, future Elixir enthusiast! 🎉

We’re absolutely thrilled to have you dive into the magical world of Elixir with us. Prepare yourself for a journey filled with new paradigms, mind-blowing concepts, and plenty of fun.

## What to Expect

Elixir might seem a bit different at first, but that’s what makes it so exciting! We’re here to help you learn and enjoy every step of the way. Focus on grasping the concepts and don’t worry too much about finishing every single exercise. The learning process is what matters here.

## Team Up for Success

The best way to tackle these challenges is with a buddy or two. Collaboration and shared learning make everything more enjoyable and effective. Plus, it’s always great to have someone to share those “aha!” moments with.

## The Challenges Await

We’ve prepared 9 fantastic challenges to help you get cozy with Elixir. Each exercise comes with its own README.md, packed with hints, explanations, and links to docs. Everything you need to succeed is right there.

## How to Check Your Solution

To work on an exercise you want to do the following:

- Navigate to the exercise folder
- Follow the instructions in the readme and docs
- Implement your changes
- Run the tests
- If the tests are green, then you've successfully completed the exercise!
- As a bonus, when you finish an exercise, call over a helper and see if they've got some handy tips to improve your already great solution!

For example:

```bash
cd ./01_structs_example_library
mix test
```

## Don’t Stress!

Remember, it’s not about finishing all the exercises. We’ve designed these challenges to cater to all levels of Elixir experience, so there’s more than enough to keep everyone engaged. Take your time, soak it all in, and most importantly, have a blast!

We can’t wait to see what you create. Happy coding! 🚀
