# Elixir-workshops

Welcome to the first Zappi Elixir workshop!

We have 9 wonderful challenges prepared for you to get familiar with elixir.
Inside this repo each exercise will have a `README.md` which will provide hints, explanations and links to docs.

To check your solution

- make sure you make the exercise your active dir. e.g. `cd ./01_structs_example_library`
- Let the module documentation guide you for the implemtation. Each exercise has ample documentation.
- Check your solution with `mix test`
- Have fun!
