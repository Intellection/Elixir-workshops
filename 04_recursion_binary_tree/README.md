# Binary Tree and Binary Tree Search

Another exercise to get used to elixirs recusion and pattern matching patterns. For this exercise use as much recursion and pattern matching as possible.

## Hint

While everything can be solved purely through pattern matching, there are some cases that feel more suited to the cond macro

## Useful Reading

- Cond: [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.17.0/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#cond/1)

## Exercise

There are two parts to the test

1. Given an array of numbers, build a binary tree, with the first element being used as the root (It will be unbalanced but that's fine)
2. Given a binary tree and a number, find the number in the tree. When the item can't be found, return nil
