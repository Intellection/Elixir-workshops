defmodule DistanceCalculator do
  @moduledoc """
  A module for calculating distances from the origin for a list of coordinates.

  This module provides functions to calculate the distance of each coordinate
  in a list from the origin (0, 0). Coordinates can have `nil` values, which are
  treated as zero for distance calculations.
  """

  @doc """
  Calculates the distances from the origin for a list of coordinates.

  ## Parameters
  - `coords` (list of tuples): A list of coordinates, where each coordinate is a tuple `{x, y}`.
    - `x` and `y` can be integers or `nil`.

  ## Returns
  - `list of floats`: A list of distances from the origin for each coordinate.

  Each coordinate in the list is processed to determine its distance from the origin:
  - If both `x` and `y` are `nil`, the distance is `0`.
  - If either `x` or `y` is `nil`, the distance is the non-`nil` value.
  - If neither `x` nor `y` is `nil`, the distance is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

  ## Examples

      iex> DistanceCalculator.distances_from_origin([{3, 4}, {nil, 5}, {7, nil}, {nil, nil}])
      [5.0, 5.0, 7.0, 0.0]

      iex> DistanceCalculator.distances_from_origin([{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {nil, 3}, {4, nil}, {nil, nil}])

  @doc """
  Calculates the distance from the origin for a single coordinate.

  ## Parameters
  - `coord` (tuple): A coordinate in the form `{x, y}`.
    - `x` and `y` can be integers or `nil`.

  ## Returns
  - `float`: The distance from the origin. The calculation rules are as follows:
    - If both `x` and `y` are `nil`, the distance is `0`.
    - If either `x` or `y` is `nil`, the distance is the non-`nil` value.
    - If neither `x` nor `y` is `nil`, the distance is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
